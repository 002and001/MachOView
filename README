A fork from MachOView to update and fix some bugs, mostly Mountain Lion & iOS 6 related.
Also some small changes to the original behaviour.

Original MachOView by psaghelyi at http://sourceforge.net/projects/machoview/.
Thanks to psaghelyi for his great work :-)

Latest versions use LLVM disassembler and are Lion+ only.
You will need to download the Clang package from http://opensource.apple.com, from Developer Tools.
Unpack it, go to src folder and run configure (you might need to install cmake, from brew or macports).
Now modify the XCode Project settings. Go to Search Paths, and add the path to clang/src/include folder to
the User Header Search Paths.

Try to compile and hopefully it should work. Not sure if this is the best way to achieve it, it works.

Enjoy,
fG!
